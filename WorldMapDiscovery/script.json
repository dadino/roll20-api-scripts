    "description": "# World Map Discovery\r\r###### Required Scripts\r* [Vector Math](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Vector%20Math)\r\rThis script allows the GM to set hidden locations on a world map that can be\rrevealed when a character gets close enough.\r\r### To use:\r\r1. Turn on the landmark's ```white-tower status``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/white-tower.png\" width=\"32\" >.\r2. Set the landmark's ```aura 1 radius``` to whatever radius you want players to come within to discover the landmark.\r3. Put the landmark on the ```GM layer```.\r\r### Discovering landmarks:\r\rWhen a character token moves within the aura radius of the landmark, the landmark \rwill appear on the graphics layer and a message will be displayed\rtelling everyone that the character discovered it. When the landmark is\rdiscovered, its aura1 radius is removed.\r",
