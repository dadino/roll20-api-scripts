AoEUtil

AoEUtil is a set of commands for streamlining area-of-effect effects.  There are
subcommands to aim an AoE effect, to select all affected targets, and to roll a
save for each affected target.

It is recommended that this script be used in conjunction with the CommandShell
module, which will improve output formatting and command discovery.


Commands:

all AoEUtil commands are accessed via the "aoe" command, which provides the
following subcommands (each described in greater detail in its own section:

    !aoe help [COMMAND]
	Display a help message.  If COMMAnd is specified, the help message will
	detail the usage of the specified subcommand.  Otherwise, the help
	message will summarize all available subcommands.

    !aoe aim [RANGE] [options]
	Creates an aiming token on top of the selected token.  If RANGE is
	specified, the aiming token will only be valid within the specified
	range of the selected token.  If a token is specified via "-t ID" or
	"--token ID", it will be used instead of the selected token.

    !aoe fire [RANGE]
	Creates targeting tokens on top of each token within range of the aiming
	token.  If RANGE is not specified, only tokens in the same space as the
	aiming token will be targeted.

    !aoe save ROLL [[COMP] DC] [options]
	Rolls a save for each targeted token, marking success or failure on the
	targeting overlay.  ROLL is a roll expression, which can access
	character attributes like "${attribute_name}" (e.g. "1d20+${reflex}").
	DC is the number against which to compare the result of ROLL.  If COMP
	is provided, it must be one of >, >=, =, <=, <, or !=.  Otherwise, it
	defaults to >=.  It is used to compare the result of ROLL to DC (e.g.
	"!aoe save 1d20+${reflex} < 42" will succeed for tokens for which
	"1d20+@{reflex}" is strictly less than 42, and fail for others).
	Tokens which successfully save will have their target token marked with
	angel wings.  Tokens which fail the save will have their target token
	marked with a skull and crossbones.  Errors will be indicated by marking
	the target token with a wrench.
	The following options are allowed:
	    -g, --gm		Only show roll results to GM (default: also show
				to players controlling affected targets)
	    -s, --summary	Show summary to everyone (default: only show
				summary to GM)
	    -f, --full		Show individual results and summary to everyone
				(default: show results to players controlling
				affected targets and summary to GM)
	    -q, --quiet		Only generate summary (no individual results)
	    -Q, --silent	Don't generate any output (only mark tokens)

    !aoe clear
	Clears any aiming and targeting tokens, removing associated internal
	state.
