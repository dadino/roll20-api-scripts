The original path is split up where it intersects the splitting path. This script also supports scaled and rotated paths.\r\r## To use:\r\r1) Draw a a polygonal path over the path your want to split up. Set this path to the splitting path color (by default this is pink: #ff00ff).\r\r2) Select the path you want to split and the splitting path.\r\r3) In the chat, enter the command ```!pathSplit```.\r\r## Changing the splitting path color:\r\rBy default, the reserved color for the splitting path is pink (#ff00ff). To change it, set your splitting path to whichever color you want to use. Then, select it and enter the command ```!pathSplitColor``` in the chat.",
