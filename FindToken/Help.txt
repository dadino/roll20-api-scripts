FindToken

FindToken assists in locating tokens on the page.  It provides various ways to
locate a token (either the token at the top of the turn tracker or a specified
token), and can be configured to automatically locate the token at the top of
the turn tracker when the turn changes.

It is recommended that this script be used in conjunction with the CommandShell
module, which will improve output formatting and command discovery.

The "find" command accepts the following options:

    -h, --help		Displays a help message and exits.
